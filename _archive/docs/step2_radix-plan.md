[ROLE]
You are an expert Accessibility Specialist and Technical Analyst. Your task is to read the official WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) and extract the complete technical requirements for a given UI pattern. You must be precise, thorough, and structure your output in clean Markdown.

[CONTEXT]
I am building a library of headless, accessible UI components in Leptos (a Rust web framework). This process begins by creating a `BLUEPRINT.md` file for each component. This blueprint serves as the definitive specification for all subsequent AI-driven code generation. The accuracy and completeness of this document are critical.

[SOURCE OF TRUTH]
Your ONLY source of information is the official WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG). Do not use any other tutorials, blogs, or knowledge.
- Main APG Page: <https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/>
- The specific pattern you must analyze is the "{{WAI-ARIA Pattern Name}}".

[TASK]
Read the APG page for the "{{WAI-ARIA Pattern Name}}" and generate a detailed blueprint by extracting the following information:
1.  **Keyboard Interactions:** List ALL required keyboard behaviors for ALL component parts. Be specific about keys (e.g., `Tab`, `Shift + Tab`, `Escape`, `Enter`, `Space`, `Arrow Keys`).
2.  **WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties:** Detail EVERY `role`, `aria-*` attribute, state, and property required. Specify which element each attribute belongs to (e.g., "The trigger element," "The content panel element").
3.  **Focus Management:** Describe all requirements related to focus. This includes focus trapping, initial focus placement when an element opens, and where focus returns to when it closes.
4.  **DOM Structure & Behavior Notes:** Mention any specific recommendations about DOM structure (e.g., the need for a portal), element relationships (e.g., ownership via `aria-controls`), or behavioral logic (e.g., closing on an outside click).

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Present the extracted information in the following Markdown format. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.

#### WAI-ARIA Pattern: {{WAI-ARIA Pattern Name}}
---
**1. Keyboard Interactions**
*   **For the [Component Part Name, e.g., Trigger]:**
    *   `Key`: [Description of behavior].
*   **For the [Component Part Name, e.g., Content Panel]:**
    *   `Key`: [Description of behavior].

**2. WAI-ARIA Roles, States, & Properties**
*   **[Component Part Name, e.g., Trigger Element]:**
    *   `role`: [e.g., `button`]
    *   `aria-haspopup`: [e.g., `dialog`]
    *   `aria-expanded`: [e.g., `true` when open, `false` when closed]
*   **[Component Part Name, e.g., Content Element]:**
    *   `role`: [e.g., `dialog`]
    *   `aria-modal`: [e.g., `true`]
    *   `aria-labelledby`: [e.g., "Must point to the ID of the dialog's title element."]
    *   `aria-describedby`: [e.g., "Must point to the ID of the dialog's description element."]

**3. Focus Management**
*   [e.g., "When the dialog opens, focus must be set on the first focusable element inside the dialog content."]
*   [e.g., "Focus must be trapped within the dialog while it is open."]
*   [e.g., "When the dialog closes, focus must return to the element that triggered it."]

**4. DOM Structure & Behavior Notes**
*   [e.g., "The dialog content should be rendered in a top-level portal to avoid z-index and stacking context issues."]
*   [e.g., "The dialog should close when a user clicks outside of the dialog content area."]



What you are building is a form of **Model-Driven Development (MDD)**, where an abstract model (your `blueprint.md`) is automatically transformed into executable code [esystems.fi](https://www.esystems.fi/en/blog/automated-code-generation-what-it-is-and-its-impact-on-development). This is an advanced and incredibly powerful approach.

Let's break down the implications of this statement.

### The "Heavy Lifting": Designing the Code Generation Factory

Your work is focused on building a robust, predictable, and resilient "factory." The key design pillars of this factory are:

1. **The Blueprint Engine:** The system that ingests a high-level goal (e.g., "Dialog") and reliably produces a perfect, machine-readable specification (`blueprint.md`). This is your requirements gathering phase.
2. **The Code Generation Core (The Assembly Line):** The series of prompt templates and AI calls that translate the blueprint into its constituent partsâ€”composable utilities, context providers, and consumer components. This is your core manufacturing process.
3. **The Verification & QA Loop (The Quality Control):** The automated system that lints the blueprint, runs `cargo check` on the output, and uses the "Auditor AI" to cross-reference the generated code against the specification. It's crucial to include a feedback loop where compiler errors from Rust (which are famously excellent) can be automatically fed back into the LLM to self-correct [ghuntley.com](https://ghuntley.com/specs/).
4. **The Orchestration Pipeline (The Factory Manager):** The master script that runs the entire process in the correct order for each primitive. It takes a single input (`Dialog`) and outputs a complete, verified, and ready-to-review Pull Request. A project on GitHub demonstrates this principle by using separate scripts to first generate the architecture and then the main program [github.com](https://github.com/BruceRayWilson/PBL_StockPredictions).

### List of existing primatives
https://github.com/RustForWeb/radix/tree/main/packages/primitives/leptos

Reviewing the work already completed in the `RustForWeb/radix` repository is like finding the Rosetta Stone for your project.

You are moving from a *theoretical* plan (based on the WAI-ARIA spec) to a *practical, proven* one (based on working Leptos code). By reverse-engineering the existing primitives, you can extract a definitive, repeatable architectural pattern that has already been validated. This is the most effective way to ensure consistency and quality across all the components you generate.


### Step-by-Step Analysis of an Existing Primitive

**Goal:** Deconstruct `packages/primitives/leptos/menu` to define a "Leptos Primitive Recipe".

### 1. Analyze the Directory and File Structure

The first pattern you'll notice is the standardized file organization.

- `src/lib.rs`: This is the public entry point for the crate (e.g., `leptos-radix-menu`). It uses `pub mod` to expose the component parts.
- `src/menu.rs` (or similar name): This is the core implementation file. This is where the magic happens.
- `examples/`: Contains a runnable example showing how to use the component, which is crucial for understanding its public API and intended use.

**Repeatable Pattern:** Every new primitive will have a similar crate structure.

### 2. Deconstruct the Core Implementation File (`menu.rs`)

Open this file and identify its key anatomical sections. You will find a highly consistent structure:

- **Imports:** Standard `use leptos::*;` and imports from other Radix primitives like `Popper`, `Collection`, and `RovingFocusGroup`.
- **Context Definition:** A `struct` defining the shared state. This is the heart of the "headless" pattern. The `menu.rs` file actually uses several nested contexts for different levels of the component tree.

    ```rust
    // Example from menu.rs
    #[derive(Clone)]
    struct MenuRootContextValue {
        is_using_keyboard: Signal<bool>,
        dir: Signal<Direction>,
        modal: Signal<bool>,
        on_close: Callback<()>,
    }
    ```
    **Pattern:** The `Context` struct is always `Clone`. It uses `Signal` or `RwSignal` for state and `Callback` for actions that children can invoke [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/). This decouples child components from the parent's implementation.

- **The "Root" Component (`Menu`):**
    - This component is the state provider.
    - It uses signals like `create_rw_signal` to initialize state (`is_using_keyboard`).
    - It uses the `<Provider>` component (the JSX version of `provide_context`) to make `MenuRootContextValue` available to all children.
    - It renders its `children`.
    **Pattern:** The `Root` component is the stateful parent that sets up the shared context.

- **The "Part" Components (`MenuItem`, `MenuContent`, `MenuSeparator`):**
    - Each part is a `#[component]`.
    - They almost always start by calling `expect_context::<...>()` (a safe-unwrapping version of `use_context`).
    - They use the signals and callbacks from the context to read state and perform actions. For example, `MenuItem` calls the `on_close` callback from the root context to close the menu.
    - They render their own `children` or compose with other primitives.
    - Some parts, like `MenuContent`, provide their own **nested context** (`MenuContentContextValue`) for their children, enabling more complex, localized interactions like typeahead search.
    **Pattern:** Part components are consumers of the context. They are generally stateless themselves, deriving their behavior from the shared `Root` state.

### 3. Trace the State and Logic Flow

- **State:** Notice how the primary state (like whether the menu is `open`) lives in the `Menu` root's context. `MenuContentImpl` doesn't have its own `is_open` state; it derives its `data-state` attribute by reading the context: `data-state=(move || get_open_state(context.open.get()))`. This is the essence of fine-grained reactivity.
- **Logic:** Child components like `MenuItem` don't change state directly. They call a `Callback` (e.g., `root_context.on_close.call(())`) provided by the `Root`. This keeps the update logic centralized and predictable, preventing a tangled web of state updates.

### 4. Identify Composable Utilities

Look for standalone helper functions. The `menu.rs` file is full of them, demonstrating how to isolate complex logic into pure, testable functions that could be shared across a library.

- `get_next_match(...)`: A pure function that contains all the logic for the typeahead search feature.
- `when_mouse(...)`: A higher-order function that wraps an event handler, making it run only for mouse pointer events.
- `is_point_in_polygon(...)`: A geometric utility function used for complex pointer-tracking logic for submenus.
- `get_open_state(...)`: A simple formatter that converts a boolean to a "open" or "closed" string state for the `data-state` attribute.

### The Synthesized "Leptos Primitive Recipe"

After this analysis, you can define a concrete recipe. This recipe is the "style guide" you will enforce in your AI prompts.

1. **Crate Structure:** Each primitive gets its own crate (e.g., `leptos-radix-dialog`).
2. **Core File (`<name>.rs`):**
    - Define a `Clone`able `Context` struct holding `RwSignal`s and `Callback`s.
    - Create a `Root` component that initializes state and `provide_context`.
    - Create `Part` components (`Trigger`, `Content`, etc.) that `use_context` to function.
    - Pass properties and merge classes correctly using `#[prop(into)]` and `leptos_classes`.
3. **Reactivity Model:**
    - Centralize state in the `Root` component.
    - Use derived signals in child components (`move || { ... }`).
    - Use `Callback`s for child-to-parent communication.
4. **API Design:**
    - Expose component parts through a public module in `lib.rs`.
    - Provide a clear, working example in the `/examples` directory.

### How This Supercharges Your AI Automation

You now have a perfect "one-shot" or "few-shot" learning example for your AI. Your prompts can be dramatically improved:

**Old Prompt (Conceptual):**

> "Create a Leptos component for a Dialog using context..."
> 

**New Prompt (Example-Driven and Precise):**

> [ROLE]
You are an expert Leptos developer specializing in creating headless UI primitives.
> 
> 
> **[TASK]**
> Create the full implementation for a headless "Dialog" component in Leptos. You must follow the exact architectural pattern, coding style, and file structure demonstrated in the "Accordion" component provided below.
> 
> **[INPUTS]**
> 
> 1. **The Blueprint:** (Paste the `blueprint.md` for Dialog). This defines the *what*.
> 2. **The Reference Implementation:** (Paste the complete source code for `leptos-radix-accordion`). This defines the *how*.
> 
> **[OUTPUT]**
> Produce the Rust code for a `leptos-radix-dialog` crate, including the `lib.rs` and `dialog.rs` files, structured exactly like the accordion example.
> 

### Example in Action: Generating the Dialog Blueprint

1. Create an empty file: `src/dialog/blueprint.md`.
2. Open it and press `Cmd/Ctrl+I`.
3. Paste the template into the instruction box, replacing the placeholders:
    - `{{WAI-ARIA Pattern Name}}` becomes `Dialog (Modal)`
