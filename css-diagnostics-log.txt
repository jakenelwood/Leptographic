LEPTOS RADIX UI - CSS DIAGNOSTICS LOG
=====================================
Date: 2025-01-08
Issue: Checkbox components showing native HTML styling instead of Phase IV custom CSS

WHAT WE KNOW:
=============
1. Components are functionally working (Phase I-III complete)
   - Checkboxes toggle states correctly
   - ARIA attributes are present
   - Event handlers work
   - State management functional

2. CSS files exist and contain Phase IV styling
   - /leptos-radix-ui/styles/checkbox.css (275 lines)
   - /leptos-radix-ui/styles/progress.css 
   - /leptos-radix-ui/styles/switch.css
   - All contain comprehensive CSS custom properties and styling

3. Components have correct CSS classes and data attributes
   - checkbox-root class applied
   - data-state attributes for styling hooks
   - data-radix-checkbox attributes

WHAT WE'VE DONE:
===============
1. ✅ Added CSS stylesheet links to app.rs:
   <Stylesheet id="checkbox" href="/styles/checkbox.css"/>
   <Stylesheet id="progress" href="/styles/progress.css"/>
   <Stylesheet id="switch" href="/styles/switch.css"/>

2. ✅ Copied CSS files to public directory:
   cp -r ../styles public/

3. ✅ Recompiled and restarted server
   - cargo leptos serve running on http://127.0.0.1:3000

4. ✅ Verified component structure has Phase IV elements:
   - CSS classes: checkbox-root, checkbox-indicator
   - Data attributes: data-state, data-disabled, data-radix-checkbox

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW:
==================
1. Are the CSS files actually being served by the server?
2. Are the CSS files being loaded in the browser?
3. Are there CSS syntax errors preventing application?
4. Are the CSS selectors matching the actual HTML output?
5. Is there a CSS specificity issue?
6. Are there conflicting styles overriding our custom CSS?

CURRENT HYPOTHESIS:
==================
The CSS files are not being properly loaded/served, causing components to fall back to native HTML styling.

Possible causes:
A) CSS files not accessible at the specified URLs
B) CSS files have syntax errors preventing loading
C) CSS selectors don't match actual HTML output
D) CSS is loading but being overridden by other styles
E) Leptos is not properly including the stylesheet links

QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
========================
1. Can we access CSS files directly via URL?
2. What does browser dev tools show for network requests?
3. What does the actual HTML output look like?
4. Are there any console errors?
5. What CSS selectors are we using vs what HTML is generated?

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS:
==================
✅ ISSUE FOUND AND RESOLVED!

Problem: CSS files were not being served by the server (404 Not Found)
Root Cause: CSS files were not in the correct public directory structure
Solution: Copied styles/ directory to public/styles/

Test Results:
- Before fix: curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000/styles/checkbox.css → 404 Not Found
- After fix: curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000/styles/checkbox.css → 200 OK (content-type: text/css)

Files now properly located at:
- /leptos-radix-ui/public/styles/checkbox.css ✅
- /leptos-radix-ui/public/styles/progress.css ✅
- /leptos-radix-ui/public/styles/switch.css ✅

Server restarted and CSS files now accessible.

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. ✅ Test page refresh to see Phase IV styling
2. Verify CSS selectors match HTML output
3. Check for any remaining styling issues
