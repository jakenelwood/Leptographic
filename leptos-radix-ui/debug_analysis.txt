LEPTOS CHECKBOX EVENT HANDLER DEBUG ANALYSIS
==============================================
Date: 2025-01-14
Issue: Leptos on:click event handler not firing

WHAT WE KNOW (CONFIRMED):
========================
‚úÖ HTML/CSS is working - element is clickable
‚úÖ Browser/JavaScript is working - basic events fire
‚úÖ Leptos builds successfully without errors
‚úÖ Component renders correctly with proper styling
‚úÖ HTML onclick handlers work (when present)
‚ùå Leptos on:click handlers DO NOT fire

WHAT WE'VE TRIED:
================
1. ‚úÖ Added HTML onclick="console.log('BASIC ONCLICK FIRED')" - WORKED
2. ‚ùå Added on:click=handle_click - DID NOT WORK
3. ‚ùå Fixed event handler parameter from |_| to |ev: ev::MouseEvent| - NO CHANGE
4. ‚ùå Removed HTML onclick to prevent conflicts - NO CHANGE
5. ‚ùå Verified Leptos event syntax matches documentation examples - NO CHANGE

CURRENT EVENT HANDLER CODE:
==========================
let handle_click = move |ev: ev::MouseEvent| {
    leptos::logging::log!("üî• CLICK HANDLER TRIGGERED! üî•");
    ev.prevent_default();
    ev.stop_propagation();
    // ... rest of handler
};

CURRENT VIEW MACRO:
==================
<button
    on:click=handle_click
    // ... other props
>

CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
==================
1. Is the handle_click closure being properly captured in the view macro?
2. Is there a scope/lifetime issue with the closure?
3. Is the Leptos event system properly initialized?
4. Are there any JavaScript console errors we're missing?
5. Is the WASM module loading correctly?
6. Is there a hydration mismatch between SSR and client?
7. Are we missing required Leptos features or imports?

IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING STEPS:
=========================
1. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Test simple button - CONFIRMED system-wide failure
2. üîç Check browser Network tab for WASM loading errors
3. üîç Check browser Console for hidden JavaScript/WASM errors
4. üîç Verify Leptos hydration is working at all
5. üîç Check Cargo.toml dependencies and features
6. üîç Test with minimal Leptos example
7. üîç Check server-side vs client-side rendering issues

CRITICAL QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
=================================
1. Is the WASM module loading successfully?
2. Are there hidden JavaScript errors in browser dev tools?
3. Is Leptos hydration happening at all?
4. Are we missing required Leptos features in Cargo.toml?
5. Is there a version compatibility issue?
6. Is the event system initialization missing?

BROWSER CONSOLE OUTPUT:
======================
- hook.js:608 using deprecated parameters for the initialization function; pass a single object instead
- No "BASIC ONCLICK FIRED" (after removing HTML onclick)
- No "üî• CLICK HANDLER TRIGGERED! üî•" (Leptos handler not firing)
- No "üß™ TEST BUTTON CLICKED - Leptos events are working!" (simple test button also fails)
- No JavaScript errors visible

üö® ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
========================
WASM IS NOT LOADING AT ALL!

Expected hydration logs completely missing:
- No "üöÄ WASM hydrate() function called!"
- No "üîß About to mount App to body..."
- No "üéØ App component rendering..."
- No "‚úÖ App mounted successfully!"

This means the WASM module is either:
1. Not being generated correctly
2. Not being loaded by the browser
3. Failing to initialize
4. Not being called by the JavaScript wrapper

CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE:
====================
‚ùå NOT checkbox-specific issues
‚ùå NOT Leptos event binding issues
‚ùå NOT closure/handler problems
‚úÖ WASM MODULE NOT LOADING/EXECUTING

REVISED HYPOTHESIS:
==================
The Leptos event system is completely non-functional. Possible causes:
1. WASM module not loading correctly
2. Leptos hydration completely broken
3. Missing critical Leptos initialization
4. JavaScript/WASM binding layer failure
5. Leptos version compatibility issues
6. Missing required features or dependencies
