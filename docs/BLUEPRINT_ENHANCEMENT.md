BLUEPRINT Enhancement Guide
This document outlines key enhancements to the blueprint.sh workflow. The goal is to create a robust, secure, and manageable development process suitable for building a commercial-grade application using an AI-driven approach.

It incorporates two main strategies: a Layered Security Model for comprehensive code validation and Visual Tooling to support architectural understanding and cognitive load management.

üõ°Ô∏è Layered Security Model
This project is a warm up to creating the processes that will be used for when creating a commercial CRM. For a commercial CRM handling sensitive data, a multi-layered approach to security is essential. This ensures that code is checked for a wide range of issues at different stages of the development lifecycle. Accordingly, we will test the approach here.

We will use a two-tiered approach: an Inner Loop for immediate developer feedback and an Outer Loop for a formal security gate.

Inner Loop: Developer Feedback
This layer provides fast, automated feedback directly to the developer within the local terminal. It's designed to catch common issues without slowing down the iterative process.

Action: Add cargo-audit and cargo-geiger to the run_quality function in blueprint.sh.

Implementation (blueprint.sh):

Bash

# Function: Run quality pipeline
run_quality() {
    echo "üîß Quality Pipeline"
    cargo fmt
    cargo fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged
    cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
    cargo test

    echo "üõ°Ô∏è Security Scan (Inner Loop)"
    # Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
    cargo audit
    # Detect unsafe code usage
    cargo geiger --deny-unsound
    # Additional security checks
    cargo deny check
    # License compliance check
    cargo deny check licenses

    echo "‚úÖ Quality complete"
}
**Prerequisites Installation:**
```bash
# Install security tools
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo install cargo-geiger
cargo install cargo-deny

# Initialize cargo-deny configuration
cargo deny init
```

**Tool Descriptions:**
- `cargo-audit`: Scans dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- `cargo-geiger`: Detects the use of unsafe code, critical for memory safety
- `cargo-deny`: Comprehensive dependency management (licenses, bans, advisories)

Outer Loop: Formal Security Gate
This layer provides a comprehensive, auditable security review. It's the official sign-off that ensures the codebase meets security and compliance standards for a commercial product.

Action: Integrate a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) platform like Codacy into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).

Implementation (CI/CD):

Configure a workflow that automatically triggers a Codacy scan on every pull request.

Set up rules to block merging if the scan discovers critical vulnerabilities.

This layered model provides the best of both worlds: rapid, developer-centric feedback and rigorous, auditable security assurance.

üé® Visual Tooling as a Cognitive Prosthetic
To manage the cognitive load of understanding a complex architecture‚Äîa challenge noted especially for those with ADHD‚Äîwe will integrate visual tools into the workflow. These tools act as "cognitive prosthetics" by externalizing the mental model of the software, freeing up cognitive resources to focus on relationships and logic.

**Recommended Tools**

**Primary: CodeSee**
- Automated codebase maps and interactive tours
- Ideal for reviewing AI-generated code with minimal manual effort
- GitHub integration for seamless workflow

**Alternative/Complementary Tools:**
- **Mermaid diagrams**: For lightweight, version-controlled architectural docs
- **Rust-specific**: `cargo-modules` for module dependency visualization
- **IDE Integration**: VS Code extensions like "Rust Analyzer" with call hierarchy

Integration Points in the Workflow
Incorporate visualization at key milestones to create a tangible map of your progress.

During Research: When analyzing existing libraries, use CodeSee to generate a dependency graph. This provides an instant visual blueprint of the patterns you intend to replicate.

After Phase II (Production Features): Once a component is feature-complete, generate a diagram using CodeSee. This acts as a visual confirmation that the component's internal structure is sound, similar to a C4 Model Level 3 (Component) diagram.

During CRM Assembly: As you combine individual components into the larger CRM application, use CodeSee to visualize the high-level dependencies between them. This helps you identify architectural issues and acts as a living C4 Model Level 2 (Container) diagram.

By making visualization a regular part of your development rhythm, you create a more manageable and sustainable process for building and maintaining a complex system.

## üöÄ **Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Security Foundation (Immediate)**
1. Install security tools: `cargo install cargo-audit cargo-geiger cargo-deny`
2. Update `blueprint.sh` with enhanced `run_quality()` function
3. Configure Codacy integration in GitHub Actions
4. Test the enhanced workflow on current Leptos-Radix components

### **Phase 2: Visual Integration (Next Sprint)**
1. Set up CodeSee account and GitHub integration
2. Generate initial codebase map for existing components
3. Create visualization checkpoints in blueprint.sh workflow
4. Document visual review process

### **Phase 3: CRM Preparation (Future)**
1. Establish security compliance baselines
2. Create architectural decision records (ADRs) with visual components
3. Set up automated security reporting for stakeholders
4. Prepare scalable CI/CD pipeline for commercial deployment
