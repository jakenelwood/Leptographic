# Security Checklist for AI-Generated Code

This checklist provides a systematic approach for manually reviewing AI-generated code to ensure security, quality, and compliance standards are met before integration.

## üéØ **Purpose**

This checklist is designed for manual review of AI-generated code as part of our layered security model. It complements automated tools (Inner Loop) and formal security gates (Outer Loop) by providing human oversight for complex security considerations that automated tools may miss.

## üîç **Pre-Review Setup**

- [ ] **Environment Prepared**: Ensure all security tools are installed and functional
- [ ] **Clean State**: Start from a clean git state with no uncommitted changes
- [ ] **Documentation Ready**: Have component requirements and specifications available
- [ ] **Context Understanding**: Review the AI prompt and intended functionality

## üõ°Ô∏è **Core Security Review**

### **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- [ ] **User Input Handling**: All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Strong typing is used throughout, no `any` types or unsafe casts
- [ ] **Boundary Checks**: Array/vector access includes proper bounds checking
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention**: No dynamic SQL construction (if applicable)
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: All user content is properly escaped for display

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] **Access Controls**: Proper permission checks before sensitive operations
- [ ] **Session Management**: Secure session handling (if applicable)
- [ ] **Token Validation**: JWT or API tokens are properly validated
- [ ] **Privilege Escalation**: No unintended privilege escalation paths
- [ ] **Default Deny**: Security defaults to deny access, not permit

### **Data Protection**
- [ ] **Sensitive Data**: No hardcoded secrets, passwords, or API keys
- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] **Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows or memory leaks (Rust helps here)
- [ ] **Data Exposure**: No unintended data exposure in logs or error messages
- [ ] **PII Handling**: Personal data is handled according to privacy requirements

### **Error Handling & Logging**
- [ ] **Error Information**: Error messages don't reveal sensitive system information
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: System fails securely, not open
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Security-relevant events are properly logged
- [ ] **Log Injection**: Log entries are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] **Exception Handling**: All exceptions are caught and handled appropriately

## üèóÔ∏è **Code Quality Review**

### **Architecture & Design**
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers
- [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components have minimal necessary permissions
- [ ] **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- [ ] **Fail-Safe Defaults**: System defaults to secure state on failure
- [ ] **Component Isolation**: Proper encapsulation and minimal coupling

### **Implementation Quality**
- [ ] **Code Clarity**: Code is readable and well-documented
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: No hardcoded values, use named constants
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of resources (files, connections, etc.)
- [ ] **Concurrency Safety**: Thread-safe operations where applicable
- [ ] **Performance Considerations**: No obvious performance bottlenecks

### **Dependencies & Supply Chain**
- [ ] **Dependency Audit**: All dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] **Version Pinning**: Dependencies use specific versions, not ranges
- [ ] **License Compliance**: All dependencies have compatible licenses
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary dependencies are included
- [ ] **Update Strategy**: Plan for keeping dependencies current

## üß™ **Testing & Validation**

### **Security Testing**
- [ ] **Negative Testing**: Test with invalid, malicious, and edge-case inputs
- [ ] **Boundary Testing**: Test limits and edge conditions
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: Test concurrent access scenarios
- [ ] **State Management**: Verify proper state transitions and validation
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions and data flow

### **Functional Testing**
- [ ] **Happy Path**: Core functionality works as expected
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**: Error conditions are handled gracefully
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs are handled
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Component meets accessibility requirements
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Works across target browsers (if web component)

## üìã **Documentation & Compliance**

### **Documentation Requirements**
- [ ] **Security Assumptions**: Document security assumptions and requirements
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Clear documentation of interfaces and contracts
- [ ] **Configuration Guide**: Secure configuration instructions
- [ ] **Deployment Notes**: Security considerations for deployment
- [ ] **Maintenance Guide**: Security maintenance and update procedures

### **Compliance Checks**
- [ ] **Coding Standards**: Follows established coding standards and conventions
- [ ] **Security Policies**: Complies with organizational security policies
- [ ] **Regulatory Requirements**: Meets applicable regulatory requirements
- [ ] **Privacy Requirements**: Complies with privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- [ ] **Audit Requirements**: Includes necessary audit trails and logging

## ‚úÖ **Final Validation**

### **Automated Tool Verification**
- [ ] **Security Scan Results**: Review and address all security tool findings
- [ ] **Code Quality Metrics**: Meet established quality thresholds
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Adequate test coverage for security-critical paths
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet performance requirements
- [ ] **Documentation Generation**: All documentation builds successfully

### **Sign-off Requirements**
- [ ] **Peer Review**: Code reviewed by at least one other developer
- [ ] **Security Review**: Security-critical components reviewed by security team
- [ ] **Architecture Review**: Complex components reviewed by architect
- [ ] **Stakeholder Approval**: Business requirements validated by stakeholders
- [ ] **Deployment Readiness**: Component ready for production deployment

## üö® **Red Flags - Immediate Review Required**

Stop and escalate if you find any of these:

- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Any passwords, API keys, or secrets in code
- **Unsafe Code Blocks**: Unnecessary `unsafe` blocks in Rust code
- **Dynamic Code Execution**: `eval()`, dynamic imports, or code generation
- **Unvalidated Redirects**: User-controlled redirects or forwards
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Custom crypto implementations or weak algorithms
- **Privilege Escalation**: Code that elevates permissions unexpectedly
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unexpected network calls or data transmission
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Potential for DoS through resource consumption
